                Ingredients<ol>
            
<li>3 cups (425g/15oz) cake flour, sifted</li>
<li>2 cups (453g/16oz) granulated sugar</li>
<li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>5 large egg whites , at room temperature</li>
<li>1 whole egg , at room temperature</li>
<li>1 cup (8floz/227ml) whole milk or full fat buttermilk</li>
<li>2 1/4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>¾ cup (170g, 6oz) unsalted butter, cold</li>
<li>Vanilla Buttercream Frosting (Master Recipe Here)</li>
            
            </ol>
                
Instructions
      <ol>         
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and line three 6-inch cake pans with parchment paper.</li>
In a large jug combine and whisk together the egg whites, whole egg, milk, and the vanilla extract. Set aside.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the dry ingredients together on low speed for 1 minute. (You can also do it by hand)
Add the cold butter and continue to mix on low until the mixture is a fine crumbly texture.
Add the liquid mixture into your dry ingredients in 2 separate batches making sure to scrape the sides and bottom before and after each batch, mixing until light, fluffy, homogenous and well incorporated. Fold once or twice to ensure the batter at bottom of bowl is incorporated.
Divide the batter evenly into the prepared pans.
Bake until a cake tester comes out with a few crumbs when inserted into the center, about 25-35 minutes. Be very careful to not over-bake. Check cake at 25 minutes to see how it is doing and judge the timing from there.
Once Bake let the cake cool on racks for 20 minutes before removing them from the tins.
When the cake is completely cold you can start to decorate. If you are not using it straight away wrap the cake tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days, refrigerator for up to 5 days, or frozen for up to 2 months.
To Assemble the Cake: With a serrated knife cut off the top of the cake layers to give them even, level surfaces to frost on.
Place bottom cake layer on the table or cake turntable.
Spread your chilled butter cream frosting on top with a small offset spatula. Gently place 2nd cake layer face down on top. Place more frosting on top of this layer and spread out.
Gently add the 3rd cake layer. Add a generous scoop of frosting and spread evenly with a small offset spatula working your way down the sides until you have a thin layer of frosting over the entire cake. This is called the “Crumb layer” . Chill until set, about 30 minutes.
Remove from refrigerator and apply a final “coat” of frosting. Decorate all over with sprinkles. Just keep on applying them until they stick all over.
Store in the fridge for up to 3 days. Before serving let it at room temperature for 30 minute and then enjoy!

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>
                Ingredients
½ cup (2oz/57g) cocoa powder
1½ cups (7.5oz/210g) all purpose flour
1½ teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
1½ sticks (6oz/180g) butter, room temperature
1 cup (8 oz/225g) sugar
3 eggs , beaten
1½ teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup (10oz/282g) plain yogurt
¼ cup (1.5oz/43g) chocolate, melted
OREO cream Cheese Frosting
2½ cups (1 lb 4 oz/574g) powdered sugar, sifted
2 cups (16oz/454g) cream cheese, at room temperature
½ cup (4oz/115g) butter, at room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
½ pack oreos plus extra for the top
                
Instructions
                
To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180oC). Grease 3 (6-inch) round cake pans or springform pans and line the bottoms with a round piece of parchment paper.
In a mixing bowl, combine the cocoa powder, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Gently mix using a spoon.
In a large mixing bowl (or on a stand mixer) combine the butter and sugar. Beat using an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Add in the eggs and vanilla and beat it on high speed. (high speed will stop this mix from separating)

Add in the yogurt and melted chocolate and mix in swiftly.
By hand, using a spatula or large spoon add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and fold in the mixture until no flour remains.
Evenly divide the batter between the 3 pans.

Bake for roughly 22-25 minutes. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Once the cake is done baking, allow them to cool completely in the pan loosely covered with foil. Once cool, remove from the tin.
To prepare the frosting: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed cream cheese and butter until smooth. Then slowly add in the powdered sugar one spoonful at a time. it is smooth and creamy (do not overbeat). Stir in the vanilla and Oreo cookie crumbs. Chill until needed
Once cakes are cool, using a serrated night shave off any lumps or bumps on top of the cake that make them uneven.
Place the first layer of cake on cake plate. Spread a spoonful of frosting on top in an even layer. Continue this step with the next two layers.
Crumb Layer: Once the cake is stacked, spread a big spoonful of frosting on top and work it down and around the sides of the cake. Cover as much as you can with a thin layer of frosting and then pop it in the fridge to chill for a minimum of 30 minutes.
Once chilled, follow with more frosting creating the final layer. Try and spread your frosting as evenly as possible. Pipe some rossetes on top and scatter over more cookie crumbs.
Enjoy straight away or keep refrigerated and eat within 3 days.</p>

                Ingredients

1 3/4 cups (250g/9oz) all-purpose flour
2 cups (400g/14oz) sugar
1/2 cup (2oz/75g) unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup (240ml/8floz) buttermilk*
1/2 cup (120g/4oz) vegetable oil, or any flavorless oil
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup (240ml/8floz) freshly brewed hot coffee
Chocolate Fudge Frosting Recipe
1 cup (240g/8oz) butter, at room temperature
6 cups (1lb 8oz/675g ) powdered sugar, SIFTED
1 1/3 cup (120g/4oz) cocoa
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup (51/2floz/165ml) whole milk
                
Instructions
                
To Make the Cake:

Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter and line 3 8-inch x 2-inch round cake pans. You can use 2 times, I just wanted 3 layers in mine.

Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together by hand.

In another bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, vanilla, and coffee
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and GENTLY mix the batter just to combine. Do not over mix or beat as this cake can toughen up.
Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean.
Note: this cake cooks fast so check if after 25 minutes. You don’t want to overcook it.
Cool in the pans for 30 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack and cool completely.
To make the Fudge Frosting: 

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat room temperature butter until lightly fluffy. Add the sifted powdered sugar 1 spoon at a time and mix well. It will get light in color and bigger

Add vanilla and cocoa, and the milk, scraping down the sides of the bowl as you work.
Turn mixer on medium high. Beat frosting until light, fluffy and of spreading consistency.
If the frosting is too thick, slowly add more milk or half & half, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.

You can use the frosting immediately, or store it in the refrigerator for 3 days, or freeze it for up to 3 months. Allow frosting to come to room temperature before using.
To Decorate: 

Place 1 layer, flat side up, on a flat plate or cake pedestal.

Create a crumb layer: With a knife or offset spatula, spread the top with frosting. Place the second layer on the top, rounded side up, and spread the frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake.
Put the cake in the fridge and let the crumb layer set for around 30 minutes (this will make the finished product look really clean)
Take the cake from the fridge and put on another, final layer of frosting. Try and get it as smooth as you can.
To finish the top of your cake, take a spoon that has been dipped in hot water and dried. Work from the outside in and create a swirl until you get to the center.
Finish your cake off with your homemade sprinkles.
Store at room temperature or in the fridge for up to 4 days. If storing in the fridge make sure it reaches room temperature before eating.</p>
